    <h2>By a better world</h2>
    <p>Rawr is a word that means “I love you” in dinosaur, but it also is this small library build to implement a lot of features to the PHP language. Rawr is an open-source project meant to make the PHP language a few better, as much as it has a lot of little failures that sometimes let me angry</p>

          <h3>Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>
          <p>Take advantage of the common algebraic interfaces to use and write
          abstractions that just work for all data structures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Modular</h3>
          <p>Include only the parts of the libraries you need in your project,
          no bloat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Fast Persistent Structures</h3>
          <p>Simplify your code-base, and reduce the amount of bugs, by using
          fast immutable data structures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Better Error Handling</h3>
          <p>Treat errors as first-class, and abstract over failure flows with
          the <code>Maybe[A]</code> and <code>Either[A, B]</code> monads.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Simpler Validations</h3>
          <p>Easily aggregate failures with the <code>Validation[A, B]</code>
          applicative functor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Simple Asynchronous Flows</h3>
          <p>Keep your asynchronous code simple with the <code>Future[A,
          B]</code> monad.</p>
        </li>
