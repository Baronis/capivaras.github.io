    <h2>By a better world</h2>
    <p>Rawr is a word that means “I love you” in dinosaur, but it also is this small library built to implement a lot of features to the PHP language. Rawr is an open-source project meant to make the PHP language a few better, as much as it has a lot of little failures that once let me angry.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>Static Typing</h3>
          <p>Have control and type security with a Haskell-like type system and types as objects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
          <p>Rawr implements several functional concepts, such as function-composition, pattern-matching, monads or algebraic-data-types.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Fast Persistent Structures</h3>
          <p>Simplify your code-base, and reduce the amount of bugs, by using
          fast immutable data structures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Better Error Handling</h3>
          <p>Treat errors as first-class, and abstract over failure flows with
          the <code>Maybe[A]</code> and <code>Either[A, B]</code> monads.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Simpler Validations</h3>
          <p>Easily aggregate failures with the <code>Validation[A, B]</code>
          applicative functor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Simple Asynchronous Flows</h3>
          <p>Keep your asynchronous code simple with the <code>Future[A,
          B]</code> monad.</p>
        </li>
