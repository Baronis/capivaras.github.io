  <p>Folktale is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and programming background. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the community organizers. Any money paid to the community or any activities associated with the community is forfeit on expulsion.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, programming experience or background, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of community activities, spaces, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>All participants in the community and community-associated activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, participants should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please <a href='/community/staff.html'>contact a member of the community staff immediately</a>.</p>

<p>Community staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your participation.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all community venues (including online venues) and social events associated with the community.</p>

<p>For any questions or with any concerns at all, please <a href='/community/staff.html'>contact our community staff</a>.</p>
