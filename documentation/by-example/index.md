Category Theory is a relatively new branch of mathematics with fairly abstract
concepts. Functional programming libraries use such concepts for maximising
their abstraction power and general usefulness, but it comes with a certain
drawback: most of the constructions provide little or no guidance for concrete
use cases. This is a problem in particular with newcomers to this style of
programming, who often find themselves lost, asking questions like “But why are
Monads useful?”

In this book, you will walk through concrete applications of category
theoretical concepts to solving problems, and allow you to build a mental
framework to generalising and abstracting problems in a way that makes your
code more reusable, and more robust. Do note that this is not a book *about*
Category Theory, but rather we
