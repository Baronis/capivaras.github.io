API Reference
=============

Folktale is a suite of libraries for generic functional programming in JavaScript. It allows the construction of elegant, and robust programs, with highly reusable abstractions to keep the code base maintainable.

The library is organised by a variety of modules split into logical categories,
with the conventional naming of ``<Category>.<Module>``. This page provides
reference documentation for all the modules in the Folktale library, including
usage examples and cross-references for helping you find related concepts that
might map better to a particular problem.
